    State Website Review

  <ol>
    <li class="Maine"> <img src="maineflag.jpg"

    style="float:right">
    <a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">Maine</a></li>

    <p>   Out of these five state websites, Maine's is the créme de la créme. With pictures of the capital, governor, and of a Maine attraction, it immediately catches the viewer's attention. The scrubbing from the top to the bottom of the screen is smooth and transitioning from computer view to mobile view is seamless. There is a search engine in the middle of the screen, but tabs at the top make looking for information very simple. Overall, Maine's website balances promoting the state with providing information very nicely. </p>

    <li class="Arkansas"> <img src="arkansasflag.jpg"
    width="225px"
    height="125px"
    style="float:right">
      <a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas</a></li>
    <p>   Although Arkansas is in 2nd place, this state's website is a very close runner-up. Although there are modern touches to the home page, such as fun fonts, pop ups and a conversation bar, the feeling of Arkansas is still very visible with images of state parks. This is one of the most clean website mechanically because of scrolling and different monitor sizes. The reason why this one did not win is because the pop ups can be a little dramatic and the images can sometimes be skewed when in small view. But overall, a very nice and welcoming state website. </p>
    <li class="Maryland"><img src="marylandflag.jpg"
    width="225px"
    height="125px"
    style="float:right">
      <a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Maryland</a></li>
    <p>   Where the first two focused on the combination of beauty and policies on a website, Maryland focuses more on the ladder, but does it in a tasteful way. Sure, it is not as eye catching, but it focuses on the colors of the state and what news pertains to Maryland. Navigating the website is fairly easy in all formats, which is very useful in today's age. As a whole, I put Maryland lower because it does not put a lot of emphasis on what the state looks like, but I appreciate how easy and clean this website was.</p>
    <li class="Alaska"><img src="alaskaflag.jpg"
    width="225px"
    height="125px"
    style="float:right">
      <a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></li>
    <p>   Up until this point, all of the websites were very computer-mobile accessible; however, Alaska's website is only built for computer screens. But other than that, the website displays the character and culture that is so pertinent to Alaska. It is very simple, but structured, filled with information, and just tasteful. Alaska's website does not go above and beyond with graphics but still has some modern touches whenever hovering over a button. Alaska's website really has only major issue and that is the lacking accessibility.</p>
    <li class="Kansas"><img src="kansasflag.jpg"
    width="225px"
    height="125px"
    style="float:right">
      <a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">Kansas</a></li>
    <p>   And finally, my least favorite website belongs to Kansas. At first, I really liked the mural that stretches across the screen, but then my appreciation stopped shortly after that when I could not find any tabs or other sections of information on the home screen. The only way to find other aspects from this website is the search bar in the middle, which, in my opinion, seems lazy. I feel like if Kansas were to do more work to add information to the front page, it would be ranked higher, but just as it is, it is not impressive.</p>
