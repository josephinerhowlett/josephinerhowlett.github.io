        <p>Many people within the Bigfork community know Phyllis Valentino as "the cool lady with a blue streak in her hair," or as the "loving substitute," but these statements do little service to the lifetime of care she has given to many students.
        </p>
        <p>This Pennsylvania-born teacher began her career in Alhambra, California, in 1969, where she taught classes to the alternative program, "the Opportunity Room." She later moved to Bigfork, Montana in 1986, as a "long term [substitute] for Kalispell Middle School," she said.</p>
        <p> However, Valentino and her husband found themselves back in California two years until 2003. She recalled her time there, saying, "I worked mostly with students who were members of the local gang, teenage mothers, and students who had difficulty in mainstream classrooms." Despite being fresh on the scene of teaching, this program did not scare her one bit, but she has "loved every minute of it."</p>
        <p> At this point in her career, she was set to retire and move back to Bigfork at which time Valentino said, "I thought I was done teaching, but then I lasted two months when I applied to be a substitute teacher, and I have been here ever since."</p>
        <p>"I am so content being in a classroom of students. It does not matter if they are from an alternative program and have difficulties or in a school district like Bigfork."</p>
        <p>Valentino has brought more than just teaching experience, though she is very well-equipped with it, but also a deep care for her students and faculty. She said, "I like being close to students because I want to understand them, be there for them if they need something."</p>
        <p>She has touched the lives of so many students, but for junior Isabella Sloan, "Mrs. Valentino has not only cared about my school life but also my personal life."</p>
        <p>Sloan elaborated saying, "She was there for me during my grandpa's cancer and encouraged me to stay positive. She is someone I can talk to about anything and that I can trust."</p>
        <p>According to senior Monique Gomez, "[Valentino] has had such a huge impact at Bigfork High with being a teacher who understands us, how we learn, how we think, and how difficult high school can be."</p>
        <p>Unlike many people in this day and age, Valentino chooses to live a life of servitude and humility. Careful to not take too much attention to herself, she often tries to let her students shine and support them in whatever way she can, similar to a loving grandmother.</p>
        <p>Fulfilling that "cool grandma" vibe, Phyllis Valentino is often remembered with her colorful hair. This annual tradition of coloring one strip of her hair blue originated when a previous student, Zac Evenson, offered during homecoming.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to be a part of the festivities along with the students, but I was not sure how to do so," Valentino admitted. "[Evenson] being the middle-schooler that he was said I should dye all of my hair blue, but I was quick to shut that down."</p>
        <p>"My hairdresser then took the idea and simplified it to one strip of hair, and I have kept this tradition ever since."</p>
        <p>Along with this and her many visits to Viking and Valkyrie activities, Valentino has always been one to support her students in whatever way she can.</p>
        <p>She may not know when her teaching career will come to an end, it is safe to say that Phyllis Valentino is always welcome in every classroom with a big heart. In the words of 2018 BHS graduate, Reuben Hubbard, "Mrs. Valentino is an absolute freaking legend."</p>
