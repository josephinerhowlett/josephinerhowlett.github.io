<h1>
  <p>The worldwide web is filled with millions of websites that many users enjoy. From educational to entertaining, and sports to material goods, there are many avenues the user can explore online. When highlighting Apple, ESPN, and NASA, it is easy to find really interesting details that set them apart from each other but it is also relatively easy to find flaws. </p>
	<p> Apple is an industry leader in terms of technology, and one of the most useful ways to stay on top of the competition is displaying their products in aesthetic and clean ways. With the launch of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/" target="_blank">iPhone 13 Pro,</a> Apple continued to use seamless scrolling that draws the viewer’s eyes down the page. In full computer screen view, there are either one or two main columns, changing to fit an image or separate section; when the window is minizimzed to fit a phone screen, the page still continues to flow nicely and is still eye catching in these two styles. Because this new version of the iPhone features a cool blue tone, the first few sections on this page highlight different blue hues that make it all cohesive. For the rest of the page, Apple mostly utilizes whites and blacks that give the site a very clean and modern look. Although this page packs a lot of content, the code used to design this page is significantly simple (as much as it can be) and Apple’s website uses HTML5 elements with DOCTYPE and different elements such as div, nav, and script. In terms of things that bring down the appeal of this site is the amount of information that Apple chooses to put on this page. From the top to bottom, there are over 50 separate sections with specifications that are new with the iPhone 13 Pro which are not only excessive but begin to become boring. It is interesting to see all of the new details and updates that can be found with this new iPhone, I just find it difficult to scroll through over 50 sections to see it all. Overall, Apple does what Apple has always done best: promote their products with websites and marketing that shows the value of their products, and this specific site is an example of that. </p>
	<p> Promoting to a another audience in a much different way is <a href="https://www.espn.com/" target="_blank">ESPN </a> with their informative and up-to-date news for the sports community. Although ESPN’s browser is adaptable between a computer monitor to a mobile screen, my personal favorite way to enjoy their website is in the former. The top of the screen is filled with current games and scores that immediately show the user how their favorite team is doing, which makes finding information even easier. In the middle, there are are the main stories, but ESPN especially excels in displaying quick links for specific sports teams, trending videos, and more that just improve the engagement on the page that much more. Similarly to Apple, ESPN does not go crazy with their programming, but continue to use HTML 5 with DOCTYPE and similar elements like Apple. The one major issue with coding, however, is that when validated through W3C’s, ESPN has a significant amount of errors and warnings, specifically with not using “alt” to describe photos for screen-readers and more. Despite these errors, ESPN is still a good website that is entertaining to look at and draws the viewers in with three columns of links and updates. There is no specific scrolling effect like seen with Apple’s website and the page has an appropriate amount of sections that vary in content rather than the continuous scrolling found on Apple. In terms of accessibility, ESPN displays all the pages in an understandable yet not overwhelming way; all the links on the top are labeled with sections such as, “NFL,” “NBA,” and more, but when you hover your mouse over any one of these titles, a drop down menu will appear with even more avenues to explore the site. In terms of theme and style, ESPN is one of the strongest websites on the internet and continues to draw in sports-lovers from all over. </p>
	<p> One of the most disappointing websites is one that belongs to possibly one of the most fascinating institutions in the world: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"> NASA</a>. Although NASA specializes in space exploration, data collection, and furthering other research programs, their website does not even work to show the incredible work or discoveries they have made. I will credit NASA with the way the website adapts from full monitor view to mobile view, but in terms of composition, there is little to no appeal in the content. Apple used different scrolling effects that switched up the flow from the top of the website and ESPN had different columns with a variety of content, but NASA uses the same white and blue caption for each photo. In addition to this, some of the photos are either blurry or not enticing which make the website seem not as high-quality as the other two. This website is also the most simple of the selection in terms of coding, which is displayed in the simpleton set up of the rest of the website. NASA uses HTML with DOCTYPE and mostly relies on head, body and div elements, but not much more than that. In full view, there is not one, but two top sections with separate tabs to click on which almost clutter up the top. In terms of color, NASA only uses black for the background and then uses white and blue to contrast that. But when an organization, like NASA, which studies very interesting and unique things, should utilize either more colors or different techniques with scrolling to draw in different types of users. NASA’s website in it of itself is not a bad website because it is useful and educational, but in terms of aesthetic and complexity, this site simply falls flat. </p>
	<p>Apple, ESPN, and NASA all vary in terms of content and display, but when examining criteria like layout, flow, colors, code, and appeal, it is easy to see why Apple’s succinctness and ESPN’s assortment are better than NASA’s bare-minimum. </p>
